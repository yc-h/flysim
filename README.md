# Flysim
The Flysim project code repository

This repository contains codes and data used in the Flysim project. The detail of the project is described in a paper "A single-cell level and connectome-derived computational model of the Drosophila brain" currently under review as of November 5, 2018.

This directory contains:
/code----c/c++ source code of the flysim simulator
/experiment----simulation data base
/experiment/ROC---- code for neuron connection prediction and for polarity identification (SPIN).
/experiment/seizure----The seizure-like hyperactivity

Neuron connection prediction and polarity identification are two separate programs used to generate the neural network model of the fruit fly based on the original neuronal data that will be released in the FlyCircuit database (http://www.flycircuit.tw/) upon the publication of the paper.
