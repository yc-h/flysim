The seizure-like hyperactivity can be reduced but not completely eliminated by stronger weights for the inhibitory synapses, as represented by the I/E factor (Figure 6A and 6B)

For each network definition in seizure/IE, run command as fellow:
./flysim.out -conf network.conf -pro network.pro -nmodel GNL2 -rp 100 | tee log





Short-term depression effectively stabilized the reconstructed fruit fly brain network by suppressing hyperactivity (Figure 7A)

For each network definition in seizure/STD, run command as fellow:
./flysim.out -conf network.conf -pro network.pro -nmodel GNL2 -STP -rp 100 | tee log
