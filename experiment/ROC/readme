Prediction of neuron connections based on distance and number of contact points (Figure 2).

Neuron polaritys are predicted by the SPIN tools(spin.tar.xz) within MATLAB, set Th_DP=0.001 and use classfier name:PCB_MED_AL_v1-2 when run goIdentifyPolarity_GUI.m.

We set 380 neurons as ground truth (get from "A Comprehensive Wiring Diagram of the Protocerebral Bridge for Visual Information Processing in the Drosophila Brain‚Äù,2013,Cell Reports], the distance and contact points criteria data(ConWgt_n380v1-2-1.zip) calculated by mainS2S.cpp 

How to the distance and contact points criteria data by using main_S2S.cpp:  
Compile mainS2S.cpp to executable file. (g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -Wall -pthread mainS2S.cpp -o s2s.out)  
Prepare your neuron's SWC file list and SWC files  
Keyin command in your console: s2s.out 1 12 SWC_file.list OutputHeader 1 70 1  
Then get results.  


In /ConWgt_n380v1-2-1, Contact points file ConWgt.txt,d?.th0 stands for distance criterion for 1um to 70um(?=1, 2, 3,...).
ConWgt.deg.d?.th0 has each neuron's in/out degree and contact points  
All files in the directory is calculated by main_S2S.cpp  


1. unzip ConWgt_n380v1-2-1.zip to /ConWgt_n380v1-2-1  
2. run ROCCmpCPUtoExpc in MATLAB, you can get ROC test results for searching the best prdiction
