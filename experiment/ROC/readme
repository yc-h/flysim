Prediction of neuron connections based on distance and number of contact points (Figure 2).

Neuron polaritys are predicted by the SPIN tools(spin.tar.xz), set Th_DP=0.001 and use classfier name:PCB_MED_AL_v1-2 when run goIdentifyPolarity_GUI.m.

We set 380 neurons as ground truth (get from "A Comprehensive Wiring Diagram of the Protocerebral Bridge for Visual Information Processing in the Drosophila Brain‚Äù,2013,Cell Reports], the distance and contact points criteria data(ConWgt_n380v1-2-1.zip) calculated by mainS2S.cpp 


In /ConWgt_n380v1-2-1, Contact points file ConWgt.txt,d?.th0 stands for distance criterion for 1um to 70um(?=1, 2, 3,...).
ConWgt.deg.d?.th0 has each neuron's in/out degree and contact points

1. unzip ConWgt_n380v1-2-1.zip to /ConWgt_n380v1-2-1
2. run ROCCmpCPUtoExpc in MATLAB, you can get ROC test results for searching the best prdiction
