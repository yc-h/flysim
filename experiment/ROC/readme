Prediction of neuron connections based on distance and number of contact points (Figure 2).

We set 380 neurons as ground truth (get from "A Comprehensive Wiring Diagram of the Protocerebral Bridge for Visual Information Processing in the Drosophila Brain‚Äù,2013,Cell Reports], compare to distance and contact points criteria calculated by mainS2S.cpp 

In /ConWgt_n380v1-2-1, Contact points file ConWgt.txt,d?.th0 stands for distance criterion for 1um to 70um(?=1, 2, 3,...).
ConWgt.deg.d?.th0 has each neuron's in/out degree and contact points

1. unzip ConWgt_n380v1-2-1.zip to /ConWgt_n380v1-2-1
2. run ROCCmpCPUtoExpc in MATLAB, you can get ROC test results for searching the best prdiction
